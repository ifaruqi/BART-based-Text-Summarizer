# BART-based-Text-Summarizer

The code takes PDF file as an input and then extract and clean the text from the file. A BART-based text summarizer is used to generate abstractive summary with a more nuanced context. 

The code has been tested with pop article and academic paper, and it provides good summary on both types of writing.
